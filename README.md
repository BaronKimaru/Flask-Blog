# FlaskStructure

### This is a Basic shell of your flask app, i.e, How your app should be organized.
This is a case where you may choose to store those configurations you wouldnt want to push to Version control. <br/ >
You may choose to store them in the Instance/config folder but this is genrally frowned upon. 
Ideally, it's better to have your configurations in a '.env' and then access them via the dotenv module
